What Is AI
=================

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that involves the creation of machines that work and react like humans.

Areas Of Application
-------------
Some of the human activities that could be programmed using artificial intelligence include:

* **Computer vision**: ability of computers to identify objects, scenes, and activities in images
* **Natural Language Processing**: ability of computers to understand meaning from text or generating text that is readable
* **Speech Processing**: automatically transcribing human speech or generating speech from the corresponding text

Where is AI Used Today?
-------------

Despite it seeming like a technology far off into the future, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are part of many of the tools we use every day. Here are just a few:

* **Google Maps** uses AI to update addresses and street names based on street view pictures. 

* **Facebook** uses AI to analyze text posted by users and better suggest ads they may need or be interested in. It also uses AI to analyse photos and identify faces. 

* **Amazon** uses AI in its recommendation engine.

Some AI Stats
--------

* AI bots will power 85% of customer service interactions by 2020
* Self-driving cars will save an estimated 300,000 lives per decade by reducing fatal traffic accidents
* AI will replace 16% of jobs over next decade
* The AI healthcare market is expected to hit $6.6 billion by 2021, according to Accenture data.
* The three most in-demand skills on Monster.com are machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing.

A New Age?
--------

Industrial Age | Information Age | 2nd Machine Age
--- | --- | ---
19th Century | 20th Century | 21st Century
Machines take away the dirty work. | Machines take away the dull and routine work. | Machines take away decisions.
Industrial equipment from looms to the cotton gin. | Automated interfaces from airline kiosks to call centers. | Intelligent systems from airfare pricing to health diagnostics
Machines relieve humans of onerous manual labour. | Technology relieves humans of routine transactions and clerical chores. | Algorithms make better choices than humans reliably and fast.


&#8291;

&#8291;

&#8291;

Why Now?
--------

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly moving from the laboratory towards business and consumer application.

* **Big Data**: Live, interactive, automatically generated, and often self-correcting data that fuels real-time decisions and real-time responses.
* **Cheaper Computing**: Cloud computing, massively parallel processing and new CPUs are powering AI techniques that simply werenâ€™t practical before.
* **Better Algorithms**: AI techniques have existed for decades but there is a surge in innovation and performance with the rapid growth in computational infrastructure, data and sensors.

What Is Machine Learning?
-----------

Machine learning involves feeding data into a special kind of computer program, specifying a particular outcome, and having a machine develop its own algorithm to achieve the outcome. (Will Knight, July 20, 2017)
